            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                I've always had an interest in computers, and I think that this is obvious
                in the amount of knowledge and background I have. I have done a little bit of
                everything, still trying to figure out what kind of work I want to do. I have
                dabbled in web design, both front and back, as well as some networking, server,
                and cybersecurity interests. I truly have a love for computers and am interested
                in pretty much ever area.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think that progress now happens on the computer and internet, and I want to 
                be a part of it. I am interested in new technology such as machine learning, 
                AI and so much more. If you are innovating in the world of technology,I am 
                automatically interested.
            </p>
            <p>
                Besides computer knowledge, I have a plethora of soft skills. I have public speaking 
                experience, and feel comfortable talking to anyone about anything. This is a necessary
                skill when communicatating with team members or clients.
